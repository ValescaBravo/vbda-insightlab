# VBDA InsightLab

VBDA InsightLab is a lightweight analytics and reporting toolkit used to produce stakeholder-ready outputs (HTML reports)
and reproducible notebooks for CRM & marketing analytics projects.

## What it helps with
- Consistent report structure (sections, callouts, key takeaways)
- Visual styling aligned to a single brand palette (NAVY/TEAL)
- Common analytics helpers used across portfolio projects (EDA, segmentation, modelling)

## Used in my portfolio projects
This library is referenced by the supporting code repositories linked from my portfolio site (project snapshots).

## Quick start (local use)
1. Clone this repo
2. In your project environment, add it to your path or install locally:

bash
```
pip install -e .
```

## Then import in Python:
```
import vbda
```
Notes:
The portfolio “full reports” are published as static HTML for easy viewing.
The GitHub repos linked from each project provide supporting evidence (notebooks, code, reproducibility).


Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
